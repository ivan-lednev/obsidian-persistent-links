# Persistent Links

## Purpose

Suppose you have a file with backlinks to some of its headings or blocks. Normally if you move these linked-to headings
and blocks, the links are going to break. This plugin listens to cut & paste events and tries to automatically update
such links.

Here is a demo:

## How to use the plugin

Just download and enable it. No configuration is required.

## Limitations

- Only works with Wiki links
- Only works with cut + paste events
